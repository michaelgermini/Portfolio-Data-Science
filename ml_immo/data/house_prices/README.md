# House Prices – Sample

This small `train.csv` sample mirrors a subset of Kaggle's House Prices columns for demo purposes:

- Id, MSZoning, Neighborhood, OverallQual, GrLivArea, GarageCars, YearBuilt, SalePrice

How to use:
- In the unified app, open "ML: House Prices". If no file is uploaded, the app auto‑loads this sample.
- You can also download it from the UI and replace with the full Kaggle dataset for better metrics.
